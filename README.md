# Hungry Billy Game Jam: Stealing

While backs are turned:
You are a thief sent to steal as much as you can from an afluent party being held by a rich baron. Your partner has told you to stash any cash you grab into the bins in/around the mansion as he can collect them later. Be careful though, the rich attendees maybe pompous but they aren't stupid, don't get caught as they will catch on and throw you out.
